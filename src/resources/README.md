### Online Resources

### Physical Resources

#### Raspberry Pis

The CSA owns two of the original [Raspberry Pi Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/) units, as well as a small collection of addons to be used with the units by students. These include:

* USB wireless internet receivers
* USB Keyboard & Mouse
* HDMI to DVI cable
* XInput gamepad (360)
* Micro USB to USB cable
* USB memory card reader

As the raspberry pi units are property of the CSA, theyâ€™re available for students to work with as they wish with the parts and funding we have available.

##### Unit 1

Unit 1 currently runs [RetroPi](https://retropie.org.uk/), a collection of emulators for the raspberry pi. This unit is commonly used at UFV events (such as uJoin) and remains set up in the SCC currently.

##### Unit 2

Unit 2 currently is sitting unused, waiting for a student with an idea to put it to use!

### Certifications

Certification can be a good way to show employers your abilities, but beware: many certifications are not recognized industry-wide or are not highly-regarded. This list is by no means exhaustive if you know of any certifications that should be added please contact us with the information at [CSA](mailto:csa.ufv@gmail.com).
