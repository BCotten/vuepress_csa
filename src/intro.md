UFV’s Computing Student Association exists to represent computing students to UFV faculty and Staff. We provide a space for students to hang out, make friends, and inquire about tutoring or help with projects. We manage the Student Computing Centre (SCC) in room D224 in D-building at the Abbotsford campus. If you have an event you want to organize, or a project you would like to run, talk with us and we’ll work with you to make it happen. The goal CSA is to fully provide a fun and enjoyable environment for students on campus, to help build a community of like-minded students from all disciplines in the CIS world.
